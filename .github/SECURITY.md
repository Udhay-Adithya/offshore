## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

When using Offshore:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update PyTorch, pandas, and other dependencies
2. **Validate input data**: Always validate stock tickers and date ranges
3. **Secure API keys**: If using premium data providers, never commit API keys
4. **Review model outputs**: This is a research tool, not financial advice
